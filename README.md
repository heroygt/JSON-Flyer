JSON-Flyer
============

"Template can fly" philosophy
-----------------------------

- Template is data, so it
 -- should have structure
 -- can be stored in Database
 -- can be queried and computed
- Render is compute between template and data or between template and template
- Template can be render in anywhere anytime.

JSON-Flyer's philosophy
-----------------------

- Template and data should have same data structure which is JSON.
- Template item and data item are matching by the key(not exact match)
- For template, CSS Selector is key, element must has a unique CSS Selector
- For data, key is same as namespace
- HTML tag will be ignored from the template element key while rendering, so data key will only match the HTML element's class and id

JSON-Flyer.js is going to achieve
------------------------------

- JSON HTML template structure
- Render from Client side
